# Self-Adaptive Financial Fraud Detection System





## Abstract

With the advancement and easy availability of financial services around the world, the scope of fraudulent transactions has also grown multifold. Financial institutes tackle this challenge by employing fraud detection systems based on advanced machine learning methods. However, financial transaction data observe a significant data drift arising from fraudsters exploiting the existing mechanisms to develop newer methods of committing credit card transaction fraud. As a result, the conventional static machine-learning models, initially effective, experience a notable decline in performance over time. In this paper, we present an implementation of a self-adaptive financial fraud detection system. This system integrates a MAPE-K loop into an MLOps process, enabling continuous monitoring of data drift and autonomous adaptation to emerging patterns. By dynamically updating and retraining the machine learning model, the proposed system effectively maintains high-performance levels, even in the face of significant data drift. The presented results underscore the efficacy of this self-adaptive framework, showcasing its ability to sustain optimal performance and adaptability amidst the ever-changing landscape of financial transaction data.
